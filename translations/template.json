  "Semi-Permissioned": "",
  "In order for a contract to launch on Kujira, it needs to be voted in via governance. This ensures that the quality, sustainability and longevity of the network are protected. A tight-knit hub of revenue generating products with great UX. \"Grown-up DeFi\" is not a meme.": "",
  "On-chain Scheduler": "",
  "The on-chain scheduler allows protocols to be designed with much less of a reliance on bots. This means there are far fewer wasted transactions. Protocols can be designed to operate more efficiently, and fees which were once required to incentivize bot usage can go back to the users of the network.": "",
  "Native Token Generation": "",
  "Smart contract developers no longer need to handle two individual entry points into their contracts, only needing to design for a native denom. In doing so, every token on the network will be a native Cosmos token, and associated liquidation and trading revenue (with more to come) will all accrue to KUJI stakers.": "",

  "Bid on ORCA": "",
  "Cosmos' first decentralized, permissionless, 100% on-chain order book style token exchange.": "",
  "Liquidity pools are out of date and no longer fit for purpose. FIN creates a fully decentralized trading experience where the need for inflationary incentives and bots are no longer required, and the risk of impermanent loss falls away entirely. Welcome to the future of the DEX.": "",
