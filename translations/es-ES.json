  "Build on Kujira": "",
  "Semi-Permissioned": "",
  "In order for a contract to launch on Kujira, it needs to be voted in via governance. This ensures that the quality, sustainability and longevity of the network are protected. A tight-knit hub of revenue generating products with great UX. \"Grown-up DeFi\" is not a meme.": "",
  "On-chain Scheduler": "",
  "The on-chain scheduler allows protocols to be designed with much less of a reliance on bots. This means there are far fewer wasted transactions. Protocols can be designed to operate more efficiently, and fees which were once required to incentivize bot usage can go back to the users of the network.": "",
  "Native Token Generation": "",
  "Smart contract developers no longer need to handle two individual entry points into their contracts, only needing to design for a native denom. In doing so, every token on the network will be a native Cosmos token, and associated liquidation and trading revenue (with more to come) will all accrue to KUJI stakers.": "",

  "Access the entire Cosmos ecosystem seamlessly in an environment with proven security and interoperability via IBC.": "",

  "Liquidate multiple assets across the whole of Cosmos at the click of a button. No bots, no code, no problems.": "",
  "ORCA is the world's first public marketplace for liquidated collateral. It's no longer a bot only game. Now you can participate in securing your favorite assets while getting discounts on them (and earn interest while you wait). Read more on Medium here. Happy hunting.": "",
  "Bid on ORCA": "",
  "Cosmos' first decentralized, permissionless, 100% on-chain order book style token exchange.": "",
  "Liquidity pools are out of date and no longer fit for purpose. FIN creates a fully decentralized trading experience where the need for inflationary incentives and bots are no longer required, and the risk of impermanent loss falls away entirely. Welcome to the future of the DEX.": "",
  "Trade on FIN": "",
  "Add multiple recipients to a single transaction. Instead of tedious repetitive tasks, it's one and done.": "",
  "Sending individual transactions over and over can be a real pain. We've got you covered. For now, a convenient tool in our suite of dApps. Moving forward, look out for BELUGA becoming a multi-featured DAO for all things payments on Cosmos.": "",
  "Send on BELUGA": "",
  "Your KUJI Dashboard. Bond KUJI to sKUJI, Vote on Governance, Swap KUJI, and claim rewards; all in one place.": "",
  "This is the heart of the Kujira ecosystem. The place where you help shape the future of the protocol via governance. It's also where you can bond KUJI to sKUJI in order to earn a portion of every cent of Kujira's revenue.": "",
